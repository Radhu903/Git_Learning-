## Radhu Ladani

- Greetings
- This is Radhu Ladani, a Post-Graduate Student from the Bharati Vidyapeeth University of Pune.
- Being a part of the CEVOpen project is a truly remarkable experience for me.
- The CEVOpen team is committed to create a single entry point for searching Open scientific literature and Phytochemistry is a key element of this project.
- My project is focused on `Phytochemical ontologies for analyzing the literature on essential oils` and began with an objective: 
   - To create a corpus of 500 papers of medicinal activity and essential oils by utilizing the getpapers toolkit, which is a web scraper for open-source scientific literature.
   - To create a dictionary of `Medicinal activity` and `Essential oil plants`, we are tapping into the potential of wikidata by converting it to dictionaries via a SPARQL query and then using the ami dict tool to convert it.
- I am extremely grateful to NIPGR. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Dr. Gitanjali Yadav and  Dr. Peter Murray Rust for their valuable guidance and life-impacting mentoring. This endeavor would not have been possible without the constant and unconditional support of all my co-interns.
